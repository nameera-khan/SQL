# SQL
My attempts at learning PostgreSQL for data analysis. 

This repository is for my progress with postgreSQL. It would consists of the queries I have used to work on various projects in the present and henceforth. 
So far, the courses I have taken on Datacamp- Fundamentals of SQL have been helping me gain active knowledge in the same. However, working only with courses does not seem to do any good if the knowledge isn't used to leeway in the right direction; AKA self-projects.
The datasets I had used for the queries are from World Bank, in regards to green house gas emissions and GDP of countries dated upto 2018. 


I have been using pgAdmin's graphic interface for postgreSQL. Although it is much more easier to use for a beginner in comparison to PSQL command line, it also comes with a query tool that allows the user to type the queries manually.
